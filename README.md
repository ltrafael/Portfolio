### [Python/Power BI] [Covid x Housing market in Brazil Part 1/2](https://github.com/ltrafael/The-Impact-of-the-Pandemic-on-the-Housing-Market-in-Brazil)
We analyzed COVID-19 and housing market data using Python and Power BI. You can read the Medium post [here](https://lnkd.in/e_Dk4EH). The two main questions answered here are:
1. How did the pandemic behave in Brazilian capitals and on a national level?
2. How did the housing market behave before and during the pandemic period?

Some of the insights extracted from the data are:
- The impacts of the pandemic were accentuated in bigger cities;
- In 2020, residential rentability went down in most of the analyzed capitals;
- There moderate/strong correlations between COVID and housing variables.

### [Python] [Analyzing student performance (pt-br)](https://github.com/ltrafael/-Educational-analysis-on-Student-Performance)
Educational analysis of student performance, this was done as part of the specialization/certificate course on data science. Contains detailed explanation of different data munging/wrangling methods and visualizations, such as:
- encoding
- discretization
- scaling, standardization and normalization
- detecting and dealing with missing values
- detecting and dealing with outliers
- validation
- feature selection
- correlation
- visualization plots

### [Power BI] [GDP Indicators in the USA](https://github.com/ltrafael/GDP-Indicators-in-the-USA)
Simple report made as practice, using GDP and population data for all USA states. Enables the selection of desired states for quick comparison. 
- Analysis of GDP, population and GDP per capita from 1997 until 2015
- Comparison between all states for the 3 variables
- Comparison of growth rates for each variable
- States with highest GDP per capita increase in this period (Way to go North Dakota!)
